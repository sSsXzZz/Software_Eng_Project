# Software_Eng_Project

RUN: 

make compile, make run, make all (compile+run)

Run in Software_Eng_Project to compile code before actually running the server:
javac -d bin/ -cp src src/server/*.java

Run in src:
java -cp ../lib/mysql-connector-java-5.1.41-bin.jar:../bin server.Server 8080


ISSUES:

Comms are a little slow (More importantly, buttons take multiple hits to get server response)

Not handling client disconnects

Not handling user signup failing because already in DB

^^^occuring with multiple clients (sometimes)

When player leaves room, playerthread doesn't wake up (sometimes)

When game is started, the room isn't removed from the lobby

Scores of each player isn't displayed (Also no invalid set displayed to client, but I don't think that matters)

Surrender button isnt functional

When host leaves, the host is changed, but that isnt updated on the UI
If Shalin's the host and Sahils in the room, if Shalin leaves, in Shalin's lobby he sees 1 person in room, sahil who is the host
However Sahil's UI doesnt change, if Shalin joins room again, Sahil's UI has Shalin (host), Sahil, Shalin while Shalin's UI has Sahil (host), Shalin, which is correct

Same person can log in multiple times

Unlimited people can join a room
